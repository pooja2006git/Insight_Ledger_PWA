## 🔍 Overview

In many parts of the world, **digital banking assumes constant connectivity**—a luxury not everyone can rely on. Whether in rural communities, during travel, or through routine outages, users are often **locked out of their own financial history** simply due to poor internet access.

**Insight Ledger** was built to **challenge that assumption**.

It’s a semi-offline, secure passbook viewer designed for environments where **connectivity is temporary but clarity is essential**. With a single login session, a user's transaction data is fetched, encrypted in-browser, and stored for **permanent offline access**.

This project sits at the intersection of:

- **Digital Inclusion**: Making fintech tools usable for underserved geographies.  
- **Data Privacy**: Client-side encryption ensures sensitive data never leaves the user’s device unprotected.  
- **Resilient Design**: Works without needing a server after setup. No fragile dependencies.  

Rather than building another interface for online banking, we reimagined the **passbook itself**—an age-old tool for personal finance clarity—and gave it a modern, encrypted, progressive form.

> Insight Ledger isn't just a technical solution—it's a rethink of what access means in an unequal internet landscape.
