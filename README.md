##  Overview

In many parts of the world, **digital banking assumes constant connectivity**â€”a luxury not everyone can rely on. Whether in rural communities, during travel, or through routine outages, users are often **locked out of their own financial history** simply due to poor internet access.

**Insight Ledger** was built to **challenge that assumption**.

Itâ€™s a semi-offline, secure passbook viewer designed for environments where **connectivity is temporary but clarity is essential**. With a single login session, a user's transaction data is fetched, encrypted in-browser, and stored for **permanent offline access**.

This project sits at the intersection of:

- **Digital Inclusion**: Making fintech tools usable for underserved geographies.  
- **Data Privacy**: Client-side encryption ensures sensitive data never leaves the userâ€™s device unprotected.  
- **Resilient Design**: Works without needing a server after setup. No fragile dependencies.  

Rather than building another interface for online banking, we reimagined the **passbook itself**â€”an age-old tool for personal finance clarityâ€”and gave it a modern, encrypted, progressive form.

> Insight Ledger isn't just a technical solutionâ€”it's a rethink of what access means in an unequal internet landscape.

##  Project Description

**Insight Ledger** is a secure and intelligent digital banking solution built to function seamlessly even in low or no internet connectivity.

> This solution stands out with its robust *security measures, smooth **authentication** flow, and efficient **data encryption. It enables users to **manage and track transactions** in a smart, user-friendly wayâ€”**even offline**.

Leveraging **Progressive Web App (PWA)** capabilities, the app ensures smooth cross-platform performance. By using **lazy loading** techniques, it significantly **reduces server load** and supports **infrastructure cost optimization** for banks.

Whether on low-end devices or unstable networks, *Smart E-Passbook* ensures that users enjoy a consistent and secure digital banking experience.

##  Features

- **Seamless Offline Access**  
  > Smart caching and IndexedDB storage allow the app to work even with low or no internet connectivity.
- **Secure Biometric & Email Authentication**  
  > Only pilot users with valid email credentials and biometric authentication can access the system securely.
- **Encrypted Data Transactions**  
  > All transaction data is protected with AES encryption, ensuring confidentiality and data integrity.
- **Cross-Platform PWA Support**  
  > Installable and functional on any deviceâ€”mobile, desktop, or tabletâ€”just like a native app.
- **Bank Infrastructure Optimization**  
  > Reduces server load and banking infrastructure cost using lazy loading techniques and local data handling.


##  How It Works

<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="work" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0b51ac9-a60b-4969-9e1e-e22b3cb3f4a7" />


The **Insight Ledger** system follows a streamlined, secure workflow from login to transaction management:

1. **User Authentication**
   - Users log in using a registered email address and password.
   - Biometric authentication (if enabled on the device) adds an extra layer of security.
   - Only valid email formats (e.g., `name@domain.com`) and strong passwords are accepted.
   
2. **Bank Account Linking**
   - Users link their bank account securely by entering:
     -  Valid account number (numeric only)
     -  IFSC code (alphanumeric, uppercase only)
     -  Real name (validated)
   - The data is encrypted using **AES encryption** before being stored or transmitted.

3. **Data Storage and Caching**
   - Upon first successful login, transaction data is fetched from the server.
   - Data is stored locally in **IndexedDB** using smart caching strategies for offline access.

4. **Transaction Visualization**
   - Transactions are displayed with dynamic icons and color-coded indicators (green for income, red for expense).
   - Users can view timestamps, categories, and transaction amounts.

5. **Offline Mode Support**
   - Users can manually toggle between **Online** and **Offline** modes via a dedicated button.
   - When offline, the app loads data from local cache (IndexedDB) and functions seamlessly.

7. **Security at Every Step**
   - Authentication is handled via *token-based login*, ensuring secure session management.
   - All requests and data exchanges are protected using *end-to-end HTTP encryption (HTTPS)*.
   
8. **Cross-Platform and Lightweight**
   - Built as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**, ensuring native-like performance on web, mobile, and tablets.
   - Optimized using **lazy loading** to reduce server load and ensure fast load times on low-end devices.
